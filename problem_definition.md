# SDG Problem Definition Document

## 1. SDG Selection
**SDG 2: Zero Hunger**

## 2. Problem Definition
Food insecurity is a critical issue affecting millions of people globally, particularly in underserved regions where access to food is scarce. The unequal distribution of food supplies worsens the situation, leading to regions with high food insecurity receiving inadequate food deliveries. Addressing this problem requires a system that monitors food shortages and ensures effective distribution to the most vulnerable areas.

### Objective
The goal is to develop a data-driven solution that tracks food distribution, analyzes patterns of food insecurity, and helps direct supplies to regions with the greatest need. By utilizing real-time data, the system can ensure equitable food distribution and help alleviate hunger in affected regions.

## 3. Digital Solution
A digital solution will involve a relational database that tracks:
- Regions affected by food insecurity.
- Food supplies available for distribution.
- Food deliveries to these regions.

### Solution Overview
The system will:
- Record the food distribution in various regions.
- Analyze delivery patterns and identify gaps in food availability.
- Provide actionable insights for decision-makers to allocate resources more efficiently.

# Database Schema: Food_Distribution_System

## Description
This schema is designed to track food supplies, food distribution, and regions affected by food insecurity. It includes tables for regions, food supplies, and distribution records.

### Key Features
- **Database design**: Tracks regions, food supplies, and food deliveries.
- **Data analysis**: SQL queries will analyze which regions are underserved based on food insecurity levels and food distribution data.
- **Excel dashboard**: Provides visual representation of food supply trends and region-based analysis.

## 4. Impact
This solution will help organizations and governments efficiently manage food distribution, ensuring that vulnerable regions receive timely and adequate food supplies, thus contributing to SDG 2â€™s mission to end hunger.
